Now we’re building the venture firm we wish existed when we were running startups. A firm that runs like a software  company. <br>\r\n\r\nWe’ve invested in 230+ companies with <a href=\"https://www.nfx.com/post/70-percent-value-network-effects\">network effects</a> built into their DNA including Lyft, Trulia, Houzz, Poshmark, and Coinbase.<br>\r\nWe did this in part by becoming students of and mastering network effects, which account for <a href=\"https://www.nfx.com/post/70-percent-value-network-effects\">70% of the value of creation in tech</a>, and we’ve been engineering them into software from day one. Now we’re using this playbook again. Today as investors, we believe software will transform the venture capital industry and <a href=\"https://www.nfx.com/post/announcing-the-new-nfx\">create a network effect VC model</a>.<br>\r\n\r\nVenture capital is a “people business”, but we’re certain that software will radically change how innovation is funded and supported in the next 10 years. There is a huge opportunity for you to build software to help founders   gain their competitive edge with fundraising, hiring, and knowledge transfer, and by opening many of our tools to the entire tech community, we’re  making an impact that is global. <br>\r\nThis role is designed for top software engineers  to learn how network effects work, get a front row seat to how high-caliber investors make decisions, and to build things from day one that will make a difference in how all Founders are funded and supported.<br>\r\nAs a Product Engineer, you will: <br>\r\n\r\n1. Build. You will own product development from idea to ship. You will work across our technologies, whether it be scaling how we handle exponentially growing data sets of the <a href=\"https://signal.nfx.com/login\">Signal</a> founder-VC network, researching and implementing latest ML/AI technologies into our VC AI, or developing a MVP of a new product to test. <br>\r\n\r\n2. Learn. You will be a student of network effects (nfx). Very few understand how they actually work, and in this role, you  you’ll have a front row seat into nfx, and will also gain a deep understanding of the relationship dynamics & nuances of the founder/VC ecosystem. You will work alongside founders and VCs, attend pitch and partner meetings, and collaborate with our team of entrepreneurs and operators. <br>\r\n\r\n3. Impact. You will be transforming a largely analog industry into one that is more efficient and effective, powered by software you create. <br>\r\n\r\nWho you are:  <br>\r\n\r\nAn engineer who has been coding professionally for 4+ years, prefers full-stack development and takes the pragmatic approach to software engineering. This is not a role for engineers who prefer just backend, frontend, or are dogmatic about using specific language, frameworks, and tools. Our stack is GraphQL/Apollo, React, Ruby/Rails, Redux.<br>\r\nYou want to be 100% immersed in tackling these challenging human problems with code, and you want to play an active role in determining product direction.This is not a role for engineers who want to code to spec.<br>\r\nYou’re looking for a full-time job in San Francisco with competitive comp, full benefits, and a small close-knit team of passionate colleagues changing how founders are funded and supported. This is not a side hustle. \r\n<p> </p></p>",

While we won&rsquo;t put a requirement on the amount of years, we do want to see your portfolio of web work. We also want to know that you&rsquo;re familiar with the tools and thinking we apply to our work:\n<ul>\n<li>HTML, CSS, JavaScript and PHP</li>\n<li>Front-end patterns, such as <a href=\"http://getbem.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">BEM</a>, <a href=\"http://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com/table-of-contents/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Atomic Design</a> and object-oriented CSS<br />Frameworks, such as <a href=\"https://reactjs.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">React</a> and <a href=\"https://vuejs.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Vue.js</a></li>\n<li>Templating tools, such as <a href=\"https://twig.symfony.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Twig</a>, <a href=\"https://reactjs.org/docs/introducing-jsx.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">JSX</a> and <a href=\"https://handlebarsjs.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Handlebars</a></li>\n<li>Module bundlers, such as <a href=\"https://webpack.js.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Webpack</a>, <a href=\"http://browserify.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Browserify</a> or <a href=\"https://parceljs.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Parcel</a></li>\n<li>PHP-based CMS platforms, such as <a href=\"https://craftcms.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Craft</a>, <a href=\"https://expressionengine.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">ExpressionEngine</a> and <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Wordpress</a></li>\n<li>Git and <a href=\"https://github.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">GitHub</a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Get with the program. </strong>While our solid team of UI/UX designers design things that people will gush over, the more you have a basic understanding of Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator and/or Sketch, the better.

Initiate. </strong>You know how to suggest and spearhead development. Here, your ideas matter. We expect you to put them into action when you see an unfulfilled need.</li>\n<li><strong>Play on a team. </strong>Participate in internal meetings on behalf of client accounts&mdash;and be willing to jump into the fray when help is needed. We expect you to follow our standards while working in the pipeline with other team members, including the UI/UX team.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you have a great personality, enjoy cracking difficult problems and are an all-around team superstar, you&rsquo;ll go far with our agency.
