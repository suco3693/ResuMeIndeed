Some of the perks our team appreciates the most, and gets super excited about include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Location: the opportunity to work in an exciting location, in office space that is warm, inviting, and inspiring. Our office is positioned just one short block from the Creative Alliance, which is buzzing weekly with new art exhibitions, dance and music performances, movie showings, poetry readings, educational programs and other events that will keep any creative person&rsquo;s heart content.<br /><br /></li>\n<li>Work Environment: Most days, we&rsquo;ve got the music pumping. And while we work hard, we also realize taking breathers throughout the day is not only necessary, but also gives us the chance to build personal relationships with those we work with side-by side. Plus, we know these little breathers ultimately make us more productive.<br /><br /></li>\n<li>Parking: It&rsquo;s plentiful, and it&rsquo;s free.<br /><br /></li>\n<li>Daily Style: We believe comfort is key and encourage you to dress in a way that is polished and professional for meetings, and work-appropriate the rest of the time.<br /><br /></li>\n<li>Coffee is Key: We know it, and you know it. If you&rsquo;re a coffee aficionado like many of us, you&rsquo;ll quickly join the daily grind at our QuickMill Anita espresso machine.<br /><br /></li>\n<li>Lunchtime Options: We&rsquo;re a quick hop, skip, or jump away from some pretty cool and eclectic hot spots, from Canton Square and Patterson Park to local favorites like Atwater&rsquo;s, DiPasquale&rsquo;s, Matthew&rsquo;s Pizza, and Snake Hill Tavern. We love food!<br /><br /></li>\n<li>Bragging Rights: We crank out award-winning work. And at the end of the day, when your name is on it, you can say you were part of making it all happen.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>About Vitamin</strong></p>\n<p>Wondering what Vitamin is all about?
